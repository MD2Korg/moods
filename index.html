					<h2 style="margin-top: 3em;">FAQ</h2>
					<ul class="tabs">
						<li>
							<h3>General Info</h3>
							<div class="split">
								<div class="content">
									<h4>What is the purpose of the MOODS study?</h4>
									<p>The purpose of the MOODS study is to understand what causes stress in daily life (i.e., daily stressors), focusing on those stress events that can be detected by wearable wrist sensors. </p>

									<h4>Who can join the MOODS study?</h4>
									<p>Any adult (18+) residing in the United States who meets the eligibility criteria for the study (<a href="#criteria">criteria</a>) can apply to participate in the MOODS study.</p>

									<h4>How long is the MOODS study for?</h4>
									<p>Each participant is to participate in the study for 100 days actively using the MOODS app and the study-provided smartwatch. Participants will receive weekly visualization of their data showing patterns of their daily stressors.</p>


								</div>
								<div class="content">
									<h4>What is the MD2K Center of Excellence?</h4>
									<p>The Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data-to-Knowledge (MD2K), headquartered at University of Memphis, was established via a grant (#U54EB020404) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2014 to develop novel computing technologies to use mobile sensor data for improving health and wellness.</p>

									<h4>Can I continue in the MOODS study beyond the required 100 days?</h4>
									<p>Yes, while the study is still ongoing. Once the study concludes, you will be notified that the services and app will be shut down and you should uninstall them from both the watch and the phone.</p>

									<h4>Can I keep the smartwatch when/if I complete the full study?</h4>
									<p>Yes, if you fulfill all requirements and complete the study.</p>

								</div>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Phone App</h3>
							<div class="split">
								<div class="content">
									<h4>How do I install the app?</h4>
									<p>Upon registration, if you are considered eligible, you will receive an invitation via email that will contain detailed instructions.</p>

									<h4>How do I use the app?</h4>
									<p>After you install the app, you will be asked to carefully read the consent form. If you agree to participate, we will send you a smartwatch for use in this study with your designated study start date. Smartwatch should be paired prior to this date and on your start date, your MOODS app and smartwatch will begin collecting data. You will receive daily invitations to confirm stress events and identify stressors. The app will also notify you each week to complete in-app surveys. </p>

									<h4>Can I reinstall the app?</h4>
									<p>Yes. You can navigate to the Google Play / Apple App Store on your device and either search for the MOODS app or reinstall it from your library.  Once you log back into the app with the same credentials, it will automatically load your previous data.</p>

									<h4>Does the app use my cellular data?</h4>
									<p>Yes. The app sends a small amount of data to the server for the purposes of logging stress and non-stress events on the server.  During the review process, it receives data from the server to power the process.  The watch will send bulk data transfers only while charging and connected to a Wi-Fi network (typically at home while you sleep).  Data rates may apply to use the app depending on your cellular plan. </p>

									<h4>What should I do if I am already wearing a smartwatch?</h4>
									<p>If you are already wearing a smartwatch, you can either choose to wear both watches on the same wrist or on different wrists. No interference is expected.</p>

									<h4>Can I use my own smartwatch for the MOODS study?</h4>
									<p>No, at this time the MOODS app can only be installed on the study provided smartwatch.</p>

									<h4>How does the MOODS app affect the smartphone battery life?</h4>
									<p>The MOODS app only communicates over Bluetooth with the smartwatch when a stress/non-stress episode has been detected. Episodes are then transferred to our servers. Our app should have a minimal impact on your smartphone’s battery life.</p>

									<h4>Can I install or use other apps on the smartwatch?</h4>
									<p>Installing or heavily using other apps is likely to further reduce the smartwatch’s battery life. Therefore, it is recommended to minimize the usage of a smartwatch for other purposes for the 100-day study duration.</p>

									</div>

								<div class="content">
									<h4>Should I wear the smartwatch in my dominant or non-dominant hand?</h4>
									<p>You can choose either wrist on which to wear the watch.</p>

									<h4>How long should I wear the watch daily?</h4>
									<p>Stress episodes can be detected only when the smartwatch is worn and fully functional. We expect the smartwatch to last approximately 8 hours on a full charge. You can always charge it again and wear it for the rest of the day. Please keep the watch on the charger while you sleep so that it is fully charged for the next morning and collected data can be uploaded.</p>

									<h4>Can I change the time of the notifications?</h4>
									<p>Yes, you can go to “Settings -> Change daily notification time” in order to set up your preferred notification time. We suggest you set the evening time so you will have time to review the weekly visualizations.</p>

									<h4>What are the episodes that are shown in the app for stressor annotation?</h4>
									<p>These consist of time intervals in which you may be either stressed or non-stressed. The reason for showing a mixture of both event types is to obtain an unbiased evaluation of the MOODS stress model.</p>

									<h4>Can I come back later to the app for annotating the episodes?</h4>
									<p>No, the annotation process must be completed once you open the app after you receive the notifications. This helps us to ensure that you are annotating your most recent recollection of the stress event(s). However, you can delete the annotated episodes later.</p>

									<h4>What do I enter in the app if I am not able to recall the stressor?</h4>
									<p>You can type in “Can’t recall” in such a case but this will limit your ability to see the patterns in different stressors because we may not include such episodes in your data analysis.</p>

									<h4>Can I delete any of the episodes?</h4>
									<p>You can mark an episode as “private” for it to be deleted.</p>

									<h4>Can I manually add stress episodes?</h4>
									<p>Yes, the app provides an option to manually add stress episodes.</p>

							<h3>Watch App</h3>
							<div class="split">
								<div class="content">
									<h4>Is it mandatory to download WearOS to use the MOODS app on the smartwatch?</h4>
									<p>Yes, the smartwatch is only functional if it is set up through WearOS.</p>

									<h4>Do I need a Google account to download and use the WearOS app?</h4>
									<p>Yes. iOS users can download the WearOS app on the phone. A Google account is required to download the necessary application to the watch.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="content">
									<h4>Can I control what information is collected by the WearOS app?</h4>
									<p>Yes. You are able to modify the settings on Android or iOS. This article has information about how to modify the settings: (note: this link is external to our website)  <a href="https://support.google.com/wearos/answer/6321353">https://support.google.com/wearos/answer/6321353</a></p>

							<h3>Stress</h3>
							<div class="split">
								<div class="content">
									<h4>What is stress and how is it calculated?</h4>
									<p>Stress is a dynamic process that reflects the brain’s response to internal and external factors, characteristics of a person and their circumstances, and interactions between people. The MOODS app uses algorithms to automatically analyze your heart rate via the LED sensor on the smartwatch. By applying a trained machine learning model, the MOODS app infers whether a physiological arousal in indicitive of stress.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="content">
									<h4>What is a stressor?</h4>
									<p>A stressor is an event, thought, threat, or challenge, i.e., “precipitant” that may trigger stress.</p>

									<h4>What is stress probability?</h4>
									<p>According to your sensor data, stress probability is the model’s guess with respect to how likely you are to be stressed.</p>

								</div>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Privacy</h3>
							<div class="split">
								<div class="content">
									<h4>Does the MOODS app collect and/or share personally identifying information?</h4>
									<p>We need your identifiable contact information such as name, address, and email address in order to ship the smartwatch and to send the weekly study emails. We may also correspond with you, and you may ask us questions, via email to ensure the study data collection is running smoothly. These identifying informations are not shared with anyone outside the study team and also not released with study data for research purposes.</p>
									<p>We collect your GPS location when stress episodes are detected by the smartwatch. This is used to visualize and analyze the impact of location on stress and stressors. We will only share de-identified semantic locations with other researchers.</p>
									<p>We also collect some non-personally identifiable information from the smartwatch and study platforms like motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope), heart rate information from the smartwatch LED sensors and stress episodes calculated from the smartwatch. After the study, we plan to share portions of de-identified data publicly to accelerate research by the community.</p>
									<p>More detailed information is located in this study’s informed consent document.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="content">
									<h4>What data does the app automatically collect?</h4>
									<p>The MOODS app automatically collects accelerometer, gyroscope, LED and GPS data from the smartwatch. This information is then used to compute inferences of whether you are stressed, your activity (e.g., whether you are moving, driving, or still), and other inferences as described in the informed consent document.</p>

									<h4>Can I pause or turn off data collection?</h4>
									<p>Yes. You can turn on the privacy mode in the MOODS app screen via the smartwatch to stop data collection.</p>

									<h4>Who will have access to the collected data?</h4>
									<p>Authorized researchers working with the study team will have access to the data. We also plan to publicly release de-identified dataset to the research community, i.e., the released dataset will not contain any identifying information such as your personal information or raw GPS.</p>

									<h4>What purposes will the data be used for?</h4>
									<p>We will only use your contact information for the purposes of contacting you about this research study, and future research studies if you choose. We will use your research data for scientific progress and for the publication of study results. Please refer to the consent document for more information about data usage and sharing. </p>
